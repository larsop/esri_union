Here is a list symlinks we need to add to run the test

Run from src/test/sql directory

mkdir loader
ln -s /usr/local/bin/shp2pgsql loader
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pgsql2shp loader
mkdir -p regress/00-regress-install/share/contrib
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/postgis/2.1.7_1/share/postgis regress/00-regress-install/share/contrib/

You may also need to set 
export POSTGIS_SCRIPT_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/postgis/2.1.7_1/share/postgis/
 
This can probably be done in better way, please let me now.

Then you can run a simple test in the regress directory

By the way ypu update the README file for run_test.pl in the file I coppiedform 

./run_test.pl --verbose --spatial_ref_sys esri_union
